 wotd_flora_and_fauna.1.desc: "While exploring the Fjords along the coast of [ROOT.GetExploration.GetLocation.GetName], [explorer.GetName] decides to venture inland to try trade and, or scavenge for supplies. While making their way through the forest at night, one of the crew members is attacked by a large green parrot-like bird. The bird seems to have mistaken the crew member for a possible mate, probably due to his green cap. The loud screeching and booming calls are heard across the forest, with the man seeming in quite a bit of pain and disarray. \n\nOne of the guides informs you that the bird is prized by locals for its delicious meat and warm coat. As the saying goes: “Only those who're never satisfied will complain of cold when wearing a Kakapo coat."

Hungry and restless, the crew launched their boats and began the hunt.\n\nAfter a long struggle, they finally brought down a massive bull nearly nine meters long.

 wotd_flora_and_fauna.3.desc: "Giant Salamanders, known to the Japanese as 'Oshanshouo' or 'Giant Pepperfish', inhabit the clear creeks and rivers within our dominion. They are often called the 'Crying Children of the Mountain' for the strange, childlike cries they make at night. When threatened, they release a strong peppery scent that carries even through the water. Revered for their longevity, they bear the marks of age, their bodies covered in deep folds and wrinkles.\n\nIn Japanese folklore, the Kappa, a mischievous yokai spirit, is said to have been inspired by this creature. Yet unlike its mythological namesake, it does not seek to drag the unwary beneath the water, and our children have nothing to fear."

The villagers revere them, claiming their flesh and organs possess medicinal properties and link them to the Kappa spirits of their myths.

While exploring inland, they come across a strange bird unlike any we have seen before. It shows no fear of us, instead pecking curiously at our helmets and boots.\n\nThe creature stands twice the size of a swan, heavy and round-bodied, with wings too small for flight.

 wotd_flora_and_fauna.7.desc: "[explorer.GetName] reports that the island’s strange birds are gone. The crew hunted them without restraint until none were left. The meat proved nearly inedible, its flavor bitter and foul.

 wotd_flora_and_fauna.8.desc: "The bird, known by locals as the “Dodo,” has become a sensation. Alongside a so-called unicorn found nearby, it draws crowds from far and wide. Its calm nature makes it a charming pet, though its diet is strange. It refuses meat and most fruits."

 wotd_flora_and_fauna.9.desc: "[explorer.GetName] writes that curiosity got the better of the crew. Having roasted one of the strange island birds, they eagerly gathered around the pot, expecting a fine meal. When the stew was served, the smell alone drove several men back. Those who tasted it spat it out at once.\n\nThe flesh is said to be dry, fibrous, and impossibly foul. One sailor even claimed to see a few birds swallowing stones. You can’t help but think: perhaps the stone would have been better."

Flightless birds that have adapted themselves to a life on the ocean, hunting for the fish near our ship. Even though, they don't dare to come any closer, compared to the dolphins in the area, their cries can be heard from far far away. These have become so obnoxious, that the crew have started calling them jackass birds, due to their donkey-like brays. \n\nTheir eggs, however, can be collected all through the year, and are a delicacy. The birds are too nervous and won’t defend them, thus collecting them has been without a hitch. It might be wise to lay claims to the islands on which these birds gather."

The local guides claim she was taken by an Orangutan, or “person of the forest.” \n\nThese great apes live alone in the canopy, seldom seen but often heard. The tribes believe they can speak and that harming them brings ruin.

Known for his adventurous, some might say reckless, spirit, we finally allowed it—if only to silence his pleas. In the jungles, he found a creature that seized his imagination. His journal reads:\n\n'Look at his little spots, those tufted ears. The pattern of stripes and smudges seems painted in haste as he ran. The locals and our men alike adore him. One even ate from my hand. The captain forbids it, but I cannot resist. I have named him Babou.'\n\n[painter_artist.GetFirstNameForEditbox] was later caught trying to bring Babou aboard.

When the Māori first settled here, they encountered the great bird they called te kura, the red bird. Towering and flightless, these creatures provided meat hunted with spears, snares, and pit traps. They shared the island with the massive Haast eagle, yet coastal communities faced little danger, as the birds were plentiful and wary.\n\nNow, only a handful of Moa survive, hidden in remote valleys. Tribes that still hunt them do so sparingly, and sightings are rare. Some bring trinkets of Moa bone and feather to trade, but most villagers speak of the birds with caution, describing them as fragile and nearly gone.\n\nThe mission was to chart Terra Australis Incognita and study the Magellanic clouds, yet the stories of these red birds have stirred curiosity.

Before the cartographers can sketch it, a shadow sweeps across the clearing. A great eagle strikes the Moa, sending feathers into the air. The struggle is violent but controlled.\n\n[explorer.GetName] signals the crew to remain still.

These baby-faced creatures have oversized ears, plump bellies, and tails so long they drag behind them as they walk. They are far gentler than the larger Asian elephants we know.\n\nTheir appearance suggests they may descend from domesticated elephants once given as gifts by the Raja of Java to the Raja Baginda of Sulu. Such exchanges were common between rulers of high standing, and the animals were often transported by sea, though these gifts were sometimes more burden than honor.\n\nThe practice has since faded.

He had assumed beavers were simply an old diminishing creature of the European waterways, yet here they were, thriving in the American forests.\n\nObserving closely, [explorer.GetFirstNameWithNoTooltip] noted the differences. The American beaver was larger, with a broader tail and darker, thicker fur, and its lodges were built with an ever impressive skill, spanning entire riverbanks.

The tale claims that the beaver, knowing how hunters prized these parts, had a cunning means of escape. If he found himself pursued and could not flee, he would bite off his own testicles and cast them upon the ground so the hunter would claim the prize and abandon the chase. The story adds that, if hunted again, the beaver would halt and show he had nothing left to offer, and so be spared once more. \n\nThough the tale is false, it recalls the hunting that nearly destroyed the European beaver. Once familiar along our rivers, it is now seldom seen, and castoreum remains valued despite bans on the trade. With the renewed study of older writings, the castor bean has regained notice, its oil serving many of the same uses once attributed to castoreum. With this substitute in hand, beavers from America may be reintroduced to our waterways, offering a chance to restore rivers and strengthen declining fish stocks."
